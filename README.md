# GrpProject
Before you start to make changes to the code please 
1. Pull the code to your Netbeans IDE.
2. Clone the code in your Netbeans IDE.
3. When you want to push your code please create a branch of the code and push that instead.
   This will help us keep just one generic code and any changes can be discusssed in the group before we merge the code.
